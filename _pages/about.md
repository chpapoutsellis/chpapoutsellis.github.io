I am an Assistant Project Scientist at UCSD. I am interested in the mathematical modelling of phenomena that emerge in oceanic flows, like surface waves and internal waves. I also have a keen interest in the global analysis of dynamical systems. 

[comment]: <> Prior to this, I was a Computational Imaging Scientist (permanent) at the [Scientific Computing Department (SCD)](https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/home.aspx) in the [Science Technology Facilities Council (STFC)](https://stfc.ukri.org/). 

I obtained a 5-year diploma and a Master's in Mathematical modelling in Modern Technologies from the  [School of Applied Mathematical and Physical Sciences](http://semfe.ntua.gr/en/) of the [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/) (NTUA). I obtained my PhD from the [School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering](https://www.ntua.gr/en/schools/item/8-school-of-naval-architecture-and-marine-engineering) of the NTUA in 2016, under the supervision of Professor [Gerassimos Athanassoulis]( https://gerassimos.athanassoulis.net/). 

I have worked as a postodoctoral researcher in France, in the [Institut de recherches sur les phénomènes hors équilibre](https://irphe.univ-amu.fr/) (IRPHE)/[Laboratoire d'Hydraulique Saint-Venant](https://www.saint-venant-lab.fr/) (LHSV), the [Centre Européen de Recherche et d’Enseignement des Géosciences de l’Environnement](https://www.cerege.fr/fr/) (CEREGE), the [Institut de mécanique des fluides de Toulouse](https://www.imft.fr/en/accueil-english/) (IMFT) and the [École nationale supérieure de techniques avancées Bretagne](https://www.ensta-bretagne.fr/fr) (ENSTA Bretagne).
